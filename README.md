# odin-recipes
My first official project (that im actually sticking to lol) using html and css. Im doing this project
while following The Odin Project so as of now (my 6th commit) im only using html and css. I may or may not 
add some javascropt to it, well see once i get further along in the curriculum. This project is a simple 
recipe website that lists a few recipe choices and links you those recipes along with pictues of the dish.
