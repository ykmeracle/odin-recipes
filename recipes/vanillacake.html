        <p>Above is a simple vanilla cake recipe for any occasion. Nothing too crazy. This recipe is great for pretty much any occasion that includes cake lol. It's plain and simple without too many additives such as fruit and whatever else people like in their cakes.</p>
<br>
<p>Below are the instructions to bake the cake. They shouldn't be that hard to follow and the appliances needed, should be in every household.</p>
<br>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch rouncd pans and line the bottoms 
        with parchment paper; butter the parchment paper and dust the pans with flour, tapping 
        out the excess.
    </li>
    <li>Whisk 3 cups if flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks of butter and the sugar in a large
        bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Reduce the mixer speed speed to medium; beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Then beat
        in the vanilla. (The mixture may look seperated at this point.)
    </li>
    <li>Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour
        until just smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans.</li>
    <li>Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cakes to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level if desired.</li>
</ol>
